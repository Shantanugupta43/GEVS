# GEVS - General Election Voting System 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting up the database system 

NOTE: make sure to have mysql workbench and mysql command line client installed in the system.

In the .env file make sure to set up the root password as per your database.

```

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=SETUP YOUR OWN DB PASSWORD
DB_DATABASE=gevs
DB_PORT=3306
SECRET_KEY=33036e729957243d3038400d7901cba42063be94db028756126f5b92245d52d0

```


To make connection successful make sure the database schema gevs is created and your own root password for database is setup.

The gevs database schema format is set to utf8 while creating the gevs database in Charset/Collation tab of mysql workbench.

After tables are created, open a new terminal and paste the code below in VS code -

### In command line Windows (VS Code) 

cmd.exe /c "mysql -u root -p gevs < sg691.sql"


This  command should push the sql script inside the database schema 'gevs'

## Starting the project 

Install all the packages using ``` npm install ```

This project uses concurrently to start the server as well as the React project at the same time.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
